# NUtilities
A collection of various tools and utilities for Unity.

## ðŸš¨ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš¨
This is a platform for adding utilities to Unity as I see fit.

â€¢ [Material Property Remapper](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NUtilities/wiki/MaterialPropertyRemapper)

â€¢ [Code Generator](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NUtilities/wiki/CodeGenerator)

----
[Utilities relating to timeline](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NTimeline) have their own package separate to this.

Other important tools I have made may remain separate to this, like:
- [NTexturePreview](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NTexturePreview) - Enhanced Texture Previewer for Unity
- [NSelection](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NSelection) - Simple selection for busy scenes in Unity

----
## Usage:
Open utility windows under: **Window/Vertx/...**

See the wiki for explanations of each utility.

## Installation
Edit your `manifest.json` file to contain `"com.vertx.nutilities": "https://github.com/vertxxyz/NUtilities.git",`

To update the package with new changes, remove the lock from the bottom of the `manifest.json` file.
